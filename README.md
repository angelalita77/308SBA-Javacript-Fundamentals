### Objectives
Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
Develop functions to create reusable code.
Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

### Instructions
You will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application.
